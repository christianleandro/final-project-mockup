# final-project-mockup
Mockup for a UH Manoa Club Hub made with Meteor. The Club Hub is a centralized, filterable directory for UH Manoa student clubs where UH Manoa students can log in with their UH username and password. Each club contains a brief description, meeting times and locations, contact information, and select images.
